# Knight Travails

A small project that solves a variation of the [Knight's Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour) problem.

Built using Ruby

## Description

If given enough turns, a knight in chess is capable of moving from one square on a chessboard to any other square on the board. This program takes in two chessboard coordinates: a starting position and an ending position. The output is the shortest move list that takes a knight from the starting square to the ending one.

This project functioned as my introduction to graphs and path-finding algorithms. I had a ton of fun making it (probably because I'm a big chess nerd).
